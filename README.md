# 208 Gametrees

In this course, we'll learn about decision trees and how we can use pathfinding algorithms as well as variations of those to build an AI!

## Passing Criteria
Implemented Minimax Algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe to create an unbeatable AI.

## Excellent Criteria
Implemented Minimax Algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe to create an unbeatable AI.

## Bonus
Design a Graph for (a part of) Stockholm's Subway System. There is:
- Stations
  - With Names
- Connections
  - From one Station to another Station
  - With a Name for the Line you're taking
  - And a Duration, how long it'd take

Now, implement a small application where you start at T-Centralen and:
- It prints all possible connections from here
- You can choose, which one to take
- Then, it updates your current station
- And repeats (loops back)

Example Output:
```
You're at T-Centralen. Possible Connections:
0: T14 to Gamla Stan (2 Minutes)
1: T17 to Gamla Stan (2 Minutes)
2: T14 to Östermalmstorg (3 Minutes)
3: T17 to Hötorget (4 Minutes)
Which  one do you want to take?
Input: 1
You're at Gamla Stan. Possible Connections:
